Repi
===========================
Repi is a tool to automatically create Python API endpoints. Avoid the hassle of setting up, installing, dealing with dependency issues, and just run any Python GitHub repository you find! Given a GitHub repository link and specified functions in that repository to turn into callable web endpoints, Repi automatically creates and runs those callable web endpoints for users to call almost immediately. Users can also specify a Docker link that the web endpoints should run in, or a GPU to run on.

This is the frontend for Repi, a Next.JS app that queries a localhost backend.

Repi has a home page with form inputs and returns the web endpoint links as a response.
